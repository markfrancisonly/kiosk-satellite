/// Camera-based motion detection.
///
/// The optimisation that keeps this off the CPU is deciding *when* to look, not
/// just how: the camera runs only while the screensaver is showing. That is the
/// only moment motion matters on a kiosk — someone approaching a dimmed screen —
/// so during normal use the camera is not bound at all. The native side
/// ([native_motion.dart] → `CameraMotion.kt`) does the frame-diffing on the YUV
/// luminance plane at a configurable low frame rate and emits a rate-limited
/// tick; here we translate that to [MotionDetected], which the screensaver
/// consumes to wake (when "dismiss on motion" is on) and the JS API / remote
/// admin observe.
///
/// "Postpone on motion" (discussion #126) is the deliberate exception to that
/// optimisation: opted in, the camera ALSO runs while the screensaver is away,
/// so nearby movement can keep resetting the idle timer and the screensaver
/// never starts over someone actually using the room. The cost warning lives
/// on the setting; the one gate kept here regardless is the screen being on —
/// a panel someone turned off has no screensaver to postpone, and a camera
/// burning CPU behind a dark screen would be the worst version of the trade.
///
/// The "Motion sensor" leg (Camera section) is the third and least gated:
/// motion as its own Home Assistant binary sensor, independent of the screensaver
/// features. It ignores even the screen-on gate above, and a truly
/// powered-off panel is its headline use: an already-open session now
/// survives screen-off because the Kiosk Satellite Service carries the
/// camera foreground type while the camera is enabled, the exemption newer
/// Android gates on — without it the OS revokes within seconds of the panel
/// going dark (measured on Android 16). Not every vendor honors the exemption:
/// One UI 11 (issue #271) suspends the session seconds after screen-off
/// regardless, and silently, so the native side runs a frame watchdog that
/// reports the suspension as a stream error. On such hardware motion
/// through a truly dark panel simply cannot work, and the Black screensaver
/// is the answer. What no version allows is *opening* the camera under a
/// dark panel, so binds are the fragile edge, not open sessions: a
/// revocation is reported as a stream error and [_onCameraLost] rebinds on
/// the next screen-on, and a bind that happened while the panel was off is
/// treated as suspect and restarted on wake (see [_boundBlind]). The cost
/// warning lives on its setting too.
///
/// The "Raise a hand" gesture is the fourth leg, and the one that is not
/// about the screensaver at all: while any gesture mapping wants a raised
/// hand, the camera runs whenever the screen is on, screensaver or not,
/// and the native palm detector reports hands held up; the gestures
/// manager turns those into the mapped action. It follows the gates the
/// other gestures follow (Lockdown Mode, kiosk mode's Disable Gestures),
/// so a locked screen does not even bind the camera for it.
///
/// All of it pauses for a voice interaction: from the wake word until
/// Voice Satellite resumes wake detection, the camera stays bound but
/// the native side emits nothing and runs no model, and anything still
/// in flight is dropped here. Someone talking at the satellite is not
/// the motion a screensaver wakes for, a face it should dismiss for, or
/// a hand showing fingers, and the turn wants the cores the detectors
/// would take. The pause is bounded (see [_pauseCeiling]) so a page that
/// never resumes wake detection cannot leave the camera blind.
