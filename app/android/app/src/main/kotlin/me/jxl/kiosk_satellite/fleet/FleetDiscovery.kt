/**
 * How the kiosks on one network find each other, so the remote admin of
 * any of them can list the rest and jump to one, and how one kiosk is
 * found by name.
 *
 * Each kiosk with its remote admin on announces
 * `ks-<id>._kiosk-satellite._tcp.local` over mDNS, with its name, version
 * and admin port in the TXT record, and listens for the same from the
 * others. Raw packets on a MulticastSocket, the way the ESPHome proxy
 * announces itself (btproxy/MdnsAnnouncer): NsdManager's callbacks never
 * fire on several of the devices this app runs on (Fire OS, old LineageOS
 * builds), and its browser is no better. Unsolicited announcements every
 * 30 seconds, a query on start that every running kiosk answers at once,
 * and a goodbye (TTL 0) on stop so a kiosk switched off leaves the list
 * instead of lingering until its records age out.
 *
 * The same announcer carries the kiosk's hostname (issue #470): an A
 * record for `<hostname>.local`, announced with the rest and answered
 * when asked for. Answering is what makes the name usable from a
 * laptop: a resolver that caches nothing it did not ask for (Windows,
 * and macOS for a name it has not seen) sends a query for the A record
 * and expects an answer, which an announce-only publisher never gives.
 * How the answer is sent matters as much as sending one, see
 * [handleQuery]: a plain multicast reply never reached a MacBook or a
 * phone on a Wi-Fi network that filters multicast toward its clients,
 * while their queries reached the kiosk fine. The reply is the A record
 * alone: the NSEC that RFC 6762 suggests, saying there is no AAAA, made
 * the Windows resolver drop the whole reply (see MdnsPackets.hostRecords).
 * The hostname part runs with Find other kiosks off too: the
 * service records and listening for peers follow that switch. The A
 * record and hostname conflict checks follow the remote admin.
 *
 * Peers are keyed by the announcing kiosk's id, dropped when their
 * goodbye arrives or when three announcements in a row went missing. The
 * address a peer is listed under is the one its announcement carries in
 * its A record, the kiosk's own admin address, and only without one the
 * address the packet came from. An mDNS reflector between VLANs re-sends
 * every announcement from the router's own address, which listed every
 * kiosk behind it as the router. A peer announcing the same hostname as
 * this kiosk is reported in the snapshot: both answer, and a browser
 * lands on either.
 *
 * A Wi-Fi MulticastLock is held while running: without it most Android
 * Wi-Fi drivers drop multicast frames with the screen off, which would
 * make a dark kiosk deaf to the others and invisible to them.
 *
 * The group is joined per interface, and joined again on every network
 * change and announcement tick (see [joinGroups]). A kiosk that starts
 * before its Wi-Fi is up, a Portal after a reboot for one (issue #582),
 * has only the loopback interface then; a join left to the kernel's
 * choice lands there and the socket hears nobody until the app is
 * restarted, whatever it announces once the network is up.
 *
 * The listener hears every mDNS response on the network, and a house
 * full of ESPHome nodes, speakers and printers sends a few hundred a
 * second. A response is looked at on its raw bytes first
 * (MdnsPackets.mentions): one that spells out neither the service label
 * nor this kiosk's hostname is dropped before any parsing, which is
 * nearly all of them. Parsing every one, and walking the network
 * interfaces for each, cost a full core on a busy network (issue #567).

     *  - A query from a port other than 5353 is a legacy one, from a plain
     *    DNS resolver that happens to send to the multicast group (Android's
     *    own resolver for `.local` names does this, so does `dig`). It is
     *    answered unicast to the sender, with the query's id and question
     *    echoed, the TTL capped at ten seconds and no cache-flush bit, or
     *    the resolver throws the reply away as not matching its question.
     *  - A query with the unicast-response bit set (the first one macOS
     *    and iOS send for a name) is answered unicast to the sender's
     *    port 5353 as well as multicast. The unicast copy is what reaches
     *    a client on an access point that does not deliver multicast to
     *    it, which is common on Wi-Fi with multicast filtering on.
     *  - Anything else is answered multicast, at most once a second.
