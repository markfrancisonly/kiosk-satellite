/**
 * Camera motion detection that stays cheap enough to leave running.
 *
 * The whole design is about doing almost nothing per frame. Fully Kiosk pulls
 * full-resolution preview frames and diffs them as RGB bitmaps at the camera's
 * native rate; this instead:
 *
 *  - asks CameraX for the smallest analysis resolution the device offers and
 *    reads only the Y (luminance) plane of the YUV frame, so there is no bitmap
 *    allocation and no color conversion at all;
 *  - throttles to a configurable frame rate (default a couple per second) by
 *    dropping every frame that arrives before the next slot is due;
 *  - reduces each processed frame to a small grid of sparsely-sampled cell
 *    averages and diffs that against the previous grid — a few hundred byte
 *    reads, not a per-pixel sweep.
 *
 * Dark rooms get two extra measures, both still cheap. Each cell learns its
 * own frame-to-frame jitter (a sigma-delta noise model) and flags change at a
 * multiple of it, so the few-count deltas a dim scene produces are detectable
 * without lowering the bright-room bar into sensor noise. And AE is asked for
 * the slowest frame-rate range the sensor offers, trading frame rate nobody
 * needs (analysis is throttled far below it) for longer exposures, which means
 * more photons per frame instead of cranked gain.
 *
 * Lighting is rejected on two levels. Each cell is thresholded on its
 * deviation from the frame's MEAN delta, not its raw delta: a light change
 * plus the AE compensation that follows it is, to first order, a uniform
 * shift of the whole grid, and subtracting the mean removes it — a body is a
 * localized departure from whatever the global shift is. (This matters with
 * the camera running across screensaver transitions: the raw transition is
 * monotone, but half a second later AE has partially re-exposed, and
 * screen-lit cells darkening while AE lifts the rest arrives mixed-sign —
 * shaped exactly like a body.) What the mean cannot absorb — light landing
 * unevenly, a lamp reaching only half the room — is caught by the raw-delta
 * sign veto: same-signed raw change is illumination, while a frame-diff of a
 * moving body has both signs at once.
 *
 * Only a "motion" tick ever crosses the channel, rate-limited to one per second.
 * The Dart side decides what motion means (waking the screensaver); the camera
 * is bound only while something is listening, and [onCancel] frees it.
 *
 * The camera is shared with [DeviceCamera]: an ImageCapture use case is
 * pre-bound into this session so a Home Assistant snapshot rides it instead
 * of contending for the sensor (see DeviceCamera for why pre-binding, not
 * on-demand binding, is the part that matters).

     * a dark panel, on a short backoff for a lit one. A session bind
     * under an already-dark panel is covered too: the seed stamp below
     * starts the clock, so a bind that parks in PENDING_OPEN and never
     * produces trips the same report instead of staying silent. The
