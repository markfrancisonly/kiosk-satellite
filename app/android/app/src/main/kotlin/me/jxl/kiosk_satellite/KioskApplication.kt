/**
 * Owns one long-lived [FlutterEngine] for the whole process, rather than
 * letting each Activity create and destroy its own.
 *
 * The point is that the Dart isolate — and everything living in it: the remote
 * admin HTTP server, the wake-word engine, the settings store — must outlive
 * the Activity. Android will destroy a backgrounded Activity while the
 * wake-word foreground service keeps the process alive; with a per-Activity
 * engine that left a running process whose admin server was gone, a socket that
 * accepted connections and never answered. A cached engine survives the
 * Activity, so the admin stays reachable as long as the process lives.
 *
 * Bridges that need no Activity on screen are set up here so they work while
 * backgrounded: the microphone (background wake word), bringing the app forward
 * on a detection, and the device facts the admin reads on demand. Bridges that
 * need a live Activity (the camera, the launch intent) are set up in
 * [MainActivity] instead.

     * a ROM advertising a back camera the device lacks (LineageOS on the
     * Echo Show 5: one front camera, the back-camera feature flag left
     * on) wedged the ProcessCameraProvider future forever, and a HAL
     * padding the list with a phantom camera whose facing is unreadable
     * (a Unisoc wall tablet: LENS_FACING 255 beside the real front
     * camera) threw before the real camera could be picked. Limiting
     * CameraX to the cameras whose facing reads makes it see only what
     * exists, and a limiter without a facing of its own keeps the
     * validator from checking feature flags against the camera list.
